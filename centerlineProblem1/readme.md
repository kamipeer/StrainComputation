 Previous to this, two simulations of a deforming beam should have been performed using FEM and SPH.
 This file reads the input files of the SPH simulation (particles_init_SPH.csv particles_end_SPH.csv) corresponding to the initial and final configuration
 It has the same input for the FEM simulation (particles_init_FEM.csv and particles_end_FEM.csv).
 The centerline of both simulations is computed and plotted in a figured. Strains in x,y,z is computed as well.
